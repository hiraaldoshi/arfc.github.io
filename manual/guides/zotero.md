# Zotero

Zotero is a convenient tool that allows a creation
of a nice, organized library that can be exported to
a .bib file later on!


## Get Started

Start with the obvious by 
[creating an account](https://www.zotero.org/user/register/) 
and joining the
[arfc group library](https://www.zotero.org/groups/arfc). 

## Install Zotero Plugins

Go to [www.zotero.org/download](www.zotero.org/download) and follow the instructions. 

If you use firefox:

1. Download Zotero Firefox Application:
2. That's it for now.


If you use something else (e.g. Chrome):

1. Download the Zotero Standalone application. 
2. Add the Zotero extension to your browser.

## To Store References:

1. Open Zotero Standalone.
2. Go to a folder (either personal or group) in which you'd like to store the reference.
3. In your browser, navigate to the reference online (this is the tricky part)
4. Click on the icon next to your address bar to 'save to Zotero'.
5. Check the new entry in Zotero. Does it have a date, author, and title?
6. If yes, you're done. If no, then enter these manually. 

### The Tricky Part

In order to 'properly' store papers and refernces, one must do so with caution.

#### Best Option: Google Scholar

Search for the article in [Google Scholar](scholar.google.com)
This will most likely ensure that the browser plugin will have access to all
the necessary information for proper citing.

You should aim to add the paper in the 'introduction page' of the paper, not the paper itself.
The first picture is when you click 'save to Zotero', not the second.

In the figure below, the results of clicking the icon in each case (Fig. 2 and Fig. 3) can be seen in the two entries. See that the entry from Fig. 3 does not contain the author and year created. However, the entry resulting from the Fig. 2 click does have all the information. If information is missing, Zotero will struggle to make a useful bibliography for you.

You can also try to maually get the data by right clicking the 'bad' reference and clicking on 
'Retrieve Metadata for PDF'.  It can fail. In that case, you may just have to 
enter the information manually.

For Web Pages, just click the 'Save to Zotero' icon.
If any crucial item is missing, type it in yourself.
To see when a website was last modified, type the following in the address bar:

```javascript:(alert(document.lastModified)```

Any other questions, look it up on google!
